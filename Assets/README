Execute the code with the below command 
npx playwright test --headed

This test case will select a product on home page
click on it
redirects to the selected product page
adds the product to cart
Clicks on Go to cart

Right now I added only one test case so we can also use the command:
npx playwright test shopify-test.spec.js
